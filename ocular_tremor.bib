	Abstract = {The neural pathways and brain regions involved in eye movements during ocular fixation and gaze control include the cerebrum, brainstem and cerebellum, and abnormal eye movements can indicate the presence of neurodegeneration. In some patients, oculomotor signs are key to making a diagnosis. Careful clinical examination of eye movements in patients with neurodegenerative disorders is, therefore, an invaluable adjunct to neurological and cognitive assessments. Eye movement recordings in the laboratory are generally not necessary for diagnostic purposes, but can be a useful addition to the clinical examination. Laboratory recordings of eye movements can provide valuable information about disease severity, progression or regression in neurodegenerative disease, and hold particular promise for objective evaluation of the efficacy of putative neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies. For example, aspects of saccade performance can be tested to probe both motor and cognitive aspects of oculomotor behaviour. This Review describes the oculomotor features of the major age-related movement disorders, including Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. Findings in presymptomatic individuals and changes associated with disease progression are discussed},

	Abstract = {Oculomotor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly characterized by a fragmentation of memory-guided gaze shifts (target is reached by several hypometric saccades). Since this phenomenon can also be observed in normal subjects, we scrutinized its pathophysiological significance in PD patients. We recorded horizontal eye movements in eleven mildly- or moderately-affected PD patients and eleven control subjects. A quantitative assessment of gaze shift fragmentation was made possible by increasing its incidence over a sequence of two visually- and two subsequent memory-guided gaze shifts. Basic saccade measures (latency, velocity, etc.) were similar in the two subject groups as well as in fragmented versus non-fragmented gaze shifts. Fragmentation probability is increased in the second memory-guided gaze shift, and this clearly more so in patients than in controls. The fragmentation shows a typical gain pattern (uniform increase of gain of saccadic amplitudes across correction saccades towards 1.0 with the last saccade of the gaze shift) independent of subject group, stimulus mode, and fragmentation degree. Gaze shift fragmentation represents a physiological phenomenon, which has thus far been overlooked. It reflects a robust correction mechanism, which assures that target is reached even if the pre-oculomotor drive through the basal ganglia to the superior colliculus becomes abnormally weak or under inadequately strong inhibition - as is postulated for PD. Thus, only the abnormally high incidence of fragmentation, and of the associated amplitude reduction of the primary saccades, rather than the phenomenon per se, can be used as a diagnostic criterion in early stages of PD.},

@article{MacAskill2016Eye-movements-i,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Abnormalities of oculomotor control accompany the pathological changes underlying many neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical examination of eye movements can contribute to differential diagnosis, whereas quantitative laboratory measures can provide detailed insight into the disease process. In this review of eye movements in neurodegenerative disease, we summarise recent empirical findings and conceptual advances.
RECENT FINDINGS: Oculomotor researchers continue to be particularly prolific in studying Parkinson's disease but there is also substantial activity in Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. Interesting findings have been reported in Huntington's, motor neuron disease, and glaucoma. Most studies report laboratory-based investigations but useful progress in clinical description continues to be made.
SUMMARY: Eye movements remain an active field of investigation across a variety of neurodegenerative conditions. Progress continues to be made at the clinical level as well by using laboratory techniques},

@article{Postuma2015MDS-clinical-di,
	Abstract = {This document presents the Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD). The Movement Disorder Society PD Criteria are intended for use in clinical research but also may be used to guide clinical diagnosis. The benchmark for these criteria is expert clinical diagnosis; the criteria aim to systematize the diagnostic process, to make it reproducible across centers and applicable by clinicians with less expertise in PD diagnosis. Although motor abnormalities remain central, increasing recognition has been given to nonmotor manifestations; these are incorporated into both the current criteria and particularly into separate criteria for prodromal PD. Similar to previous criteria, the Movement Disorder Society PD Criteria retain motor parkinsonism as the core feature of the disease, defined as bradykinesia plus rest tremor or rigidity. Explicit instructions for defining these cardinal features are included. After documentation of parkinsonism, determination of PD as the cause of parkinsonism relies on three categories of diagnostic features: absolute exclusion criteria (which rule out PD), red flags (which must be counterbalanced by additional supportive criteria to allow diagnosis of PD), and supportive criteria (positive features that increase confidence of the PD diagnosis). Two levels of certainty are delineated: clinically established PD (maximizing specificity at the expense of reduced sensitivity) and probable PD (which balances sensitivity and specificity). The Movement Disorder Society criteria retain elements proven valuable in previous criteria and omit aspects that are no longer justified, thereby encapsulating diagnosis according to current knowledge. As understanding of PD expands, the Movement Disorder Society criteria will need continuous revision to accommodate these advances. {\copyright} 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

@article{Volkmann1996Central-motor-l,
	Abstract = {A variety of clinical and experimental findings suggest that parkinsonian resting tremor results from the involuntary activation of a central mechanism normally used for the production of rapid voluntary alternating movements. However, such central motor loop oscillations have never been directly demonstrated in parkinsonian patients. Using magnetoencephalography, we recorded synchronized and tremor-related neuromagnetic activity over wide areas of the frontal and parietal cortex. The spatial and temporal organization of this activity was studied in seven patients suffering from early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Single equivalent current dipole (ECD) analysis and fully three-dimensional distributed source solutions (magnetic field tomography, MFT) were used in this analysis. ECD and MFT solutions were superimposed on high-resolution MRI. The findings indicate that 3 to 6 Hz tremor in PD is accompanied by rhythmic subsequent electrical activation at the diencephalic level and in lateral premotor, somatomotor, and somatosensory cortex. Tremor-evoked magnetic activity can be attributed to source generators that were previously described for voluntary movements. The interference of such slow central motor loop oscillations with voluntary motor activity may therefore constitute a pathophysiologic link between tremor and bradykinesia in PD},

@article{Burkhard2002Voluntarily-sim,
	Abstract = {Based on the hypothesis that rhythmical, tremor-like movements produced by normal subjects might be influenced by similar central oscillatory neuronal networks believed to determine the features of the pathologic tremors of Parkinson's disease (PD) or Essential Tremor (ET) patients, we examined the neurophysiological characteristics of a tremor mimicked by normal volunteers and compare this data with those from PD or ET tremors. Voluntarily simulated tremor (VST) was studied in 47 neurologically intact subjects, resting tremor in 10 patients with PD and postural tremor in 10 patients with ET. Using a tremor analysis system based on a solid state gyroscopic sensor sensitive to angular rate, the following parameters were determined: frequency, amplitude (angular displacement) and regularity (Q coefficient of constancy). We also performed an inertial loading test and a test-retest analysis. Nearly all normal subjects were able to simulate a tremor that was indistinguishable, in frequency and regularity, from that of PD or ET, although the amplitude was significantly higher in normal subjects. As in pathological tremors, the VST frequency was significantly influenced by age, but not by gender, handedness or previous knowledge of tremor. Inertial load did not modify the tremor frequency, suggesting that mechanical factors were minor. We also found a logarithmic inverse relationship between frequency and amplitude of the VST. We concluded that VST shares many similarities with pathological tremors. It is therefore possible that all tremors are somehow influenced by the same central oscillators which may become disinhibited and clinically apparent in pathological conditions such as PD or ET},

@article{MacAskill2012The-influence-o,
	Abstract = {Studies of saccades in Parkinson's disease (PD) have seldom examined the influence of cognitive status, ranging from normal cognition, through mild cognitive impairment, to dementia. In a large and heterogeneous sample, we examined how motor and cognitive impairment was reflected in the performance of reflexive, visually-guided saccades. We examined 163 people with PD and 47 similar-aged controls. Ninety three of the PD group had normal cognition (PDN), 48 had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and 22 had dementia (PDD). Pseudo-random targets (amplitudes of 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees and inter-stimulus-intervals ranging from 550 to 1800 ms) were shown in 108 mixed randomised trials, incorporating gap, step, and overlap onset conditions. Analyses were conducted using multi-level regression modeling. Participants were first assessed by continuous measures (Unified PD Rating Scale motor score and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Prolonged latency was significantly related to both motor and cognitive impairment, with the cognitive effect being compounded by increasing age. Decreased saccade amplitude, meanwhile, was primarily related to motor impairment. When assessed by discrete cognitive categories, all of the PD groups showed reduced saccadic amplitude relative to controls. Saccadic latencies, meanwhile, were abnormally prolonged only in the PD-MCI and PDD groups (the control and PDN groups were similar to each other). Latency in the overlap task was particularly sensitive to increasing motor and cognitive impairment. We conclude that reflexive saccades in PD are subtly decreased in amplitude even early in the disease process. Prolonged saccade latency, meanwhile, tends to occur later in the disease process, in the presence of more substantial motor and cognitive impairment, and greater age. The progressive impairment of reflexive saccades, and the differential onset of amplitude and latency impairments, may make them a useful objective tool for assessing disease status.},

	Abstract = {We reviewed the clinical and laboratory oculomotor features in 30 patients with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA), 22 with MSA-P and 8 with MSA-C. Six patients were also examined post mortem, MSA being confirmed in four and excluded in two (Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy). Clinical examination showed the following abnormalities; excessive square wave jerks†-†21 of 30 patients; mild vertical supranuclear gaze palsy†-†8 of 30; gaze-evoked nystagmus†-†12 of 30 patients, three of whom had no extraocular evidence of cerebellar dysfunction; positioning downbeat nystagmus†-†10 of 25; mild or moderate saccadic hypometria†-†22 of 30; impaired (ldquobroken uprdquo) smooth pursuit†-†28 of 30; reduced VOR suppression†-†16 of 24.

Our findings suggest that the presence of excessive square wave jerks, mild - moderate hypometria of saccades, impaired VOR suppression, spontaneous nystagmus or positioning downbeat nystagmus may be oculomotor ldquored flagsrdquo or clues to the presence of MSA. Further, the presence of clinically slow saccades, or moderate-to-severe gaze restriction, suggests a diagnosis other than MSA. {\copyright} 2008 Movement Disorder Society},

@article{MacAskill2002Adaptive-modifi,
	Abbr_2 = {Brain},
	Abstract = {The accuracy of saccades (fast eye movements) is maintained over time and is an adaptive ability usually ascribed to the cerebellum. Adaptation might occur elsewhere in certain tasks, such as in the prefrontal cortex for memory-guided saccades. We hypothesized that adaptation of memory-guided saccades would be impaired in Parkinson's disease, as basal ganglia dysfunction can disrupt the operation of the prefrontal cortex, while adaptation of visually guided saccades would be preserved. Adaptation was induced by consistently yet imperceptibly displacing targets as saccades were made toward them, causing artificial saccadic inaccuracy. Twelve Parkinson's disease subjects (OFF medication) and 12 age-matched controls performed 245 visually- and memory-guided horizontal saccades in separate sessions. An infrared eye tracker detected the saccade, during which the target was displaced by 12.5\% of the size of the initial jump, either in the same (centrifugal) or the opposite (centripetal) direction. Parkinson's disease subjects made smaller visually guided saccades than did controls [F(1,20) = 9.10, P < 0.01], yet both groups modified saccade size appropriately. Parkinson's disease memory-guided saccades were also smaller than those of controls [F(1,19) = 5.93, P < 0.05]. While controls decreased (by 8.6\%) or increased (by 4.1\%) the size of these saccades appropriately, Parkinson's disease subjects decreased saccade size in response to both centripetal adaptation (by an excessive 18.3\%) and centrifugal adaptation (by 3.5\%). Parkinson's disease subjects were less able to modify saccadic size appropriately when the movement size was specified in motor memory: a predilection for excessive hypometria was invoked, regardless of adaptation direction. This indicates that, in certain tasks, saccadic adaptation involves structures other than the cerebellum.},

	Abstract = {A recent study in control subjects suggested the existence of separate pathways for oculomotor spatial working memory tasks depending on whether the delay before movement execution is either short or long (> 20 s). The long delay pathway may bypass brain areas commonly affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to assess spatial working memory in Parkinson's disease using short (3 s) and long (30 s) delays in a memory-guided saccade task. 15 mild-moderately affected PD subjects off-medication and 15 age and sex-matched controls were tested (PD mean age 65.3; control 65.9). Subjects were tested in a darkened room using a horizontal LED bar to generate eye movements which were recorded using an infrared limbus tracker. Percentage error in amplitude of the primary saccade was analysed by repeated measures ANOVA. There was a significant interaction between the groups and their response to the short and long delay periods (p < 0.02). PD subjects were more strongly impaired in the short delay than the long delay trials when compared to controls. Analysis of the percentage error in amplitude of the final eye position showed the same pattern but only in female subjects. This study provides the first evidence that the proposed parallel spatial memory pathway utilised in longer delay periods is relatively unimpaired in PD. In a broader sense, our results suggest that there may be other alternative pathways to overcome deficits in functions impaired by PD.},

@article{Sharma2013Biomarkers-in-P,
	Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder mostly affecting the aging population over sixty. Cardinal symptoms including, tremors, muscle rigidity, drooping posture, drooling, walking difficulty, and autonomic symptoms appear when a significant number of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are already destroyed. Hence we need early, sensitive, specific, and economical peripheral and/or central biomarker(s) for the differential diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of PD. These can be classified as clinical, biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and neuroimaging biomarkers. Novel discoveries of genetic as well as nongenetic biomarkers may be utilized for the personalized treatment of PD during preclinical (premotor) and clinical (motor) stages. Premotor biomarkers including hyper-echogenicity of substantia nigra, olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, depression, hyposmia, deafness, REM sleep disorder, and impulsive behavior may be noticed during preclinical stage. Neuroimaging biomarkers (PET, SPECT, MRI), and neuropsychological deficits can facilitate differential diagnosis. Single-cell profiling of dopaminergic neurons has identified pyridoxal kinase and lysosomal ATPase as biomarker genes for PD prognosis. Promising biomarkers include: fluid biomarkers, neuromelanin antibodies, pathological forms of α-Syn, DJ-1, amyloid β and tau in the CSF, patterns of gene expression, metabolomics, urate, as well as protein profiling in the blood and CSF samples. Reduced brain regional N-acetyl-aspartate is a biomarker for the in vivo assessment of neuronal loss using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and T2 relaxation time with MRI. To confirm PD diagnosis, the PET biomarkers include [(18)F]-DOPA for estimating dopaminergic neurotransmission, [(18)F]dG for mitochondrial bioenergetics, [(18)F]BMS for mitochondrial complex-1, [(11)C](R)-PK11195 for microglial activation, SPECT imaging with (123)Iflupane and βCIT for dopamine transporter, and urinary salsolinol and 8-hydroxy, 2-deoxyguanosine for neuronal loss. This brief review describes the merits and limitations of recently discovered biomarkers and proposes coenzyme Q10, mitochondrial ubiquinone-NADH oxidoreductase, melatonin, α-synculein index, Charnoly body, and metallothioneins as novel biomarkers to confirm PD diagnosis for early and effective treatment of PD},

@article{Shulman1996Internal-tremor,
	Abstract = {Although sensory symptoms were not originally described in Parkinson's disease (PD), in recent years it has been increasingly recognized that painful sensations and paresthesias occur in approximately 40\% of patients. It has been our observation that PD patients often describe a sensation of internal tremor, a feeling of tremor inside the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs that cannot be seen. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of internal tremor by administering a questionnaire to 100 consecutive patients with PD and 50 age-matched controls seen in our movement disorders center. A sensation of internal tremor was present in 44\% of this sample of PD patients and in 6\% of the control population (p < 0.0001). The presence of internal tremor was unrelated to Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, duration of disease, or the presence of observable tremor. The frequency of other sensory symptoms (aching, tingling, burning) was higher in the PD patients with internal tremor (73\%) than in those without (45\%; p = 0.005). Internal tremor is associated with anxiety in 64\% of patients (p < 0.0001). It was described as uncomfortable and was unrelieved by antiparkinsonian medication in three quarters of patients. A sensation of internal tremor is commonly reported by PD patients and should be recognized as a useful diagnostic factor in PD},

	Abstract = {A novel technique for the study of human eye movements was used to investigate the frequency components of ocular drift and microtremor in both eyes simultaneously. The tangential components of horizontal eye accelerations were recorded in seven healthy subjects using light-weight accelerometers mounted on scleral contact lenses during smooth pursuit movements, vestibulo-ocular reflexes and eccentric gaze with and without fixation. Spectral peaks were observed at low (up to 25 Hz) and high (60-90 Hz) frequencies. A multivariate analysis based on partial coherence analysis was used to correct for head movement. After correction, the signals were found to be coherent between the eyes over both low- and high-frequency ranges, irrespective of task, convergence or fixation. It is concluded that the frequency content of ocular drift and microtremor reflects the patterning of low-level drives to the extra-ocular muscle motor units.},

@article{McAuley2000Physiological-a,
	Abstract = {In recent years there has been increasing interest in oscillatory neural activity in the CNS and in the role that such activity may have in motor control. It is thought that physiological tremor may be a manifestation in the periphery of such central oscillatory activity and that some pathological tremors are the result of derangement of these oscillators. This review re-evaluates both early and recent studies on physiological and pathological tremors and other peripheral oscillations in order to gain a new perspective on the nature and function of their central progenitors. This approach, namely using tremor as a 'window' into the function of central oscillations, is particularly suited to human investigations because of the obvious limitations of direct central recording. It is argued that physiological tremor is likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions not only from CNS 10-Hz range oscillatory activity, but also from motor unit firing properties, mechanical resonances and reflex loop resonances. Different origins are likely to dominate under different conditions. While some pathological tremors appear to arise as a distortion of central or peripheral components of physiological tremor, others arise de novo, such as the pathological oscillation of 3- to 6-Hz parkinsonian tremor. CNS oscillations outside the 10-Hz range are also found to modulate limb activity in normal individuals, and oscillatory activity exists in other motor systems such as eye movements. Finally, it is shown how studies of peripheral oscillations may help develop hypotheses on the role of CNS oscillations in motor control, including the proposed 'binding' function of synchronized oscillations and the possibility that motor signals could be coded by frequency of modulating oscillation as well as by synaptic connectivity},

@article{Vaillancourt2000The-dynamics-of,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study examines the time and frequency structure of Parkinson's disease tremor in patients that exhibit no clinical signs of tremor.
METHODS: Eight mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and 8 matched control subjects maintained their limb in a constant position (30 s) under a postural finger, postural hand and resting tremor condition. Finger acceleration from the middle phalange, electromyographic (EMG) activity from extensor digitorum communis and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) were recorded.
RESULTS: The data confirmed that there were no differences in the amount of limb motion and the modal frequency was around 9 Hz for each subject group. The time-dependent organization of tremor was more regular (lower approximate entropy [ApEn]) in Parkinson's disease. Both time and frequency analyses between the acceleration and extensor EMG signals demonstrate a reduction in the 20-25 Hz tremor component and an increase in the 8-12 Hz region of tremor.
CONCLUSIONS: The results are discussed in relation to the proposal that increased regularity results from an increase in motor unit synchronization at 8-12 Hz and a reduction in the amplitude of the 20-25 Hz tremor component. The time and frequency structure of tremor may be useful in assessing individuals with Parkinson's disease},

@article{Schnitzler2006Physiological-a,
	Abstract = {Human brain functions are heavily contingent on neural interactions both at the single neuron and the neural population or system level. Accumulating evidence from neurophysiological studies strongly suggests that coupling of oscillatory neural activity provides an important mechanism to establish neural interactions. With the availability of whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) macroscopic oscillatory activity can be measured non-invasively from the human brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. To localise, quantify and map oscillatory activity and interactions onto individual brain anatomy we have developed the 'dynamic imaging of coherent sources' (DICS) method which allows to identify and analyse cerebral oscillatory networks from MEG recordings. Using this approach we have characterized physiological and pathological oscillatory networks in the human sensorimotor system. Coherent 8 Hz oscillations emerge from a cerebello-thalamo-premotor-motor cortical network and exert an 8 Hz oscillatory drive on the spinal motor neurons which can be observed as a physiological tremulousness of the movement termed movement discontinuities. This network represents the neurophysiological substrate of a discrete mode of motor control. In parkinsonian resting tremor we have identified an extensive cerebral network consisting of primary motor and lateral premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, thalamus/basal ganglia, posterior parietal cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex, which are entrained in the tremor or twice the tremor rhythm. This low frequency entrapment of motor areas likely plays an important role in the pathophysiology of parkinsonian motor symptoms. Finally, studies on patients with postural tremor in hepatic encephalopathy revealed that this type of tremor results from a pathologically slow thalamocortical and cortico-muscular coupling during isometric hold tasks. In conclusion, the analysis of oscillatory cerebral networks provides new insights into physiological mechanisms of motor control and pathophysiological mechanisms of tremor disorders},

	Abstract = {We report on fixation instabilities in a patient diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). This patient underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery bilaterally in the vicinity of the subthalamic nuclei (STN). Examination of the eye movements of this patient revealed marked fixation instability compared with a healthy age matched control. The eye movements occurring during fixation differed from other reports of fixation instabilities in that they interrupted fixation for only brief durations. These interruptive saccades (IS) had saccade-like amplitude velocity relationships. The frequency of these IS was higher in the patient with PD than in the healthy age matched control. Furthermore, the frequency of the IS in the patient reduced toward control with application of bilateral DBS in the vicinity of the STN. From our observations we conclude that fixation ability may be altered in PD and improved with DBS},

@article{Kaski2013Ocular-tremor-i,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the origin of a recently reported ocular microtremor in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: Eye movements were recorded in 2 unselected patients with PD. Two recording techniques were used to control for artifacts: infrared video-oculography and infrared scleral reflection techniques. Head movements were also recorded with 2 different accelerometers.
RESULTS: We recorded ocular oscillations in both patients (microtremor). Ocular tremor was accompanied by a recordable (but clinically nonvisible) head tremor of equal fundamental frequency and high coherence with both the eye oscillation and a recordable limb tremor. The eye movements were in the opposite direction to the head oscillation (ie, compensatory) and were suppressed by head restraint. There was no subjective oscillopsia, nor ocular tremor on fundoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: The "ocular tremor" observed in patients with PD disease is a compensatory eye movement secondary to transmitted head tremor, in agreement with clinical wisdom that these patients do not report oscillopsia. {\copyright} 2013 Movement Disorder Society},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Studying eye movements can provide insight into how the normal brain works, how diseases affect eye movements, and how eye movement abnormalities can be used to study diseases and/or their treatments. In this review, we concentrate on recent studies looking at abnormalities of saccades in various diseases.
RECENT FINDINGS: Various saccadic abnormalities have been found in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, dementia, cerebellar disease, schizophrenia, and several other conditions. In some of these, saccadic abnormalities appear to be capable of distinguishing different subtypes (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy from idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal dementia, or one type of spinocerebellar ataxia from another). Several studies have looked at functional associations of saccadic abnormalities (e.g., reading in spinocerebellar ataxia or recovery from stroke), which may prove clinically useful. Studies on microsaccades have revealed abnormalities in various diseases, and suggest that they may provide a useful marker of fatigue.
SUMMARY: Saccadic eye movements provide an excellent way of studying the human motor system in health and disease, as well as providing insight into various aspects of cognitive function. Assessment of saccades in the laboratory and at the bedside is likely to become increasingly useful clinically},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Our recent report of ocular tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) has raised considerable controversy as to the origin of the tremor. Using an infrared based eye tracker and a magnetic head tracker, we reported that ocular tremor was recordable in PD subjects with no apparent head tremor. However, other investigators suggest that the ocular tremor may represent either transmitted appendicular tremor or subclinical head tremor inducing the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The present study aimed to further investigate the origin of ocular tremor in PD.
METHODS: Eye movements were recorded in 8 PD subjects both head free, and with full head restraint by means of a head holding device and a dental impression bite plate. Head movements were recorded independently using both a high sensitivity tri-axial accelerometer and a magnetic tracking system, each synchronized to the eye tracker.
RESULTS: Ocular tremor was observed in all 8 PD subjects and was not influenced by head free and head fixed conditions. Both magnetic tracking and accelerometer recordings supported that the ocular tremor was fully independent of head position.
CONCLUSION: The present study findings support our initial findings that ocular tremor is a fundamental feature of PD unrelated to head movements. Although the utility of ocular tremor for diagnostic purposes requires validation, current findings in large cohorts of PD subjects suggest its potential as a reliable clinical biomarker},
